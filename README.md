POLIR
-----
This is the most-updated version of the POLIR code written by [Gungor Ozer](http://www.gungorozer.net/). I am updating it to
  * test its functionality in the current day and 
  * reproduce his results from when the code was written.

Currently, this repository only contains the code from the directory named `waterEquilFinal`.
Once this is fixed and working, I plan on moving forward with the rest of the programs.
Each subdirectory has its own README with compilation instructions, input explanation, and a list of TODOs.
